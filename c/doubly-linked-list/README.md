#### Comparison of Singly and Doubly Linked List

The main benefit of a doubly linked list over a singly linked list is that popping from the back of the list is now in O(1) instead of O(n) - since the nodes of a doubly linked list keep track of their predecessor as well, it is possible to access the node that comes immediately before the tail directly from the tail itself instead of traversing through the list starting from the head.

Other operations remain the same in terms of algorithmic complexity - in general, it is still necessary to traverse through the list starting from the head (or tail, in cases where it might be faster to start from there) to access elements of the list, so operations involving accessing a general element of the list will still be O(n).
