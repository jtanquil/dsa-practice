#### Time Complexity of Linked List Implementation

`front`: returning the front element is in O(1) because the data structure keeps track of the `head`, and `front` just needs to access that element and return its `item` value.

`back`: returning the back element is also in O(1) because the data structure keeps track of the `tail`, and `back` just needs to return its `item` value. Without keeping track of `tail` this would be O(n) because `back` would need to traverse through the list, starting at `head`, to access `tail`.

`push_front`: pushing an element to the front of the list is O(1) because creating a new list node, setting its `next` value to be the current `head`, and updating the list's `head` to this new node are all constant time operations.

`push_back`: pushing an element to the back of the list is O(1) because creating a new list node, setting the `next` value of the current `tail` to that new node, and then updating the list's `tail` value to that new node are all constant time operations. Note that updating the `next` value of the old `tail` is only constant time because the list keeps track of the `tail`; without that, `push_back` would be in O(n) because accessing the tail would require traversing the list starting from `head`.

`pop_front`: popping the front element of the list is O(1) because returning the value of `head`, setting `head->next` to be the new `head`, and freeing the memory allocated to the old `head` are all constant time operations.

`pop_back`: popping the back element of the list is O(n) because `pop_back` needs to access the element immediately preceding `tail` to set it to be the new `tail`, but that requires traversing the list starting at `head` and therefore is in O(n). Updating the `tail` to this list node and freeing up the memory allocated to the old `tail` are both constant time, so this operation as a whole is in O(n).

`insert`: inserting a node with value `item` into a given `index` of the list is O(n), because it requires traversing through the list, starting from `head`, to find the node immediately preceding the node with that given `index`. Splicing a new node into the list involves creating a new node whose value is `item`, setting the preceding node's `next` to that new node, and setting the new node's `next` to the previous node's old `next`, which are all constant time, so the operation as a whole is O(n).

`value_at`: returning the value at a given `index` is O(n) because it requires traversing through the list starting at `head` until reaching the node at `index`.

`value_n_from_end`: returning the value `n` indices away from the end of the list is also O(n) because it still involves traversing the list through `head`.

`erase`: removing an element from a given `index` is O(n) because like `insert`, it requires traversing through the list to find the element preceding the node at `index`. Removing the node at `index` requires changing the `next` value of the precedessor node to the `index` node's `next` value, and freeing up the memory allocated to the `index` node, which are both constant time, so the operation as a whole is in O(n).

`remove_value`: removing the first instance of a given `item` from the list is O(n) because it requires traversing through the list starting from `head`.

`reverse`: reversing the order of the list is in O(n) because it involves traversing through the list starting from `head`.

#### Comparison with Dynamic Array

This linked list implementation can insert elements at the beginning and end (assuming that the list keeps track of the `tail`) in O(1) time, because the operation only involves creating a new list node and updating a constant number of values (the list's `head` and/or `tail`, and possibly the `next` values of one or two nodes). While adding an element to the end of the dynamic array implementation is in O(1), adding an element to the front of the dynamic array is in O(n) because it involves shifting the position of every other element of the array. Note that inserting an element into a given `index` is O(n) for both data structures - the linked list implementation must traverse through the list starting at `head`, and the dynamic array will need to shift the elements after the inserted element.

The linked list can remove elements from the front of the list in O(1), while the dynamic array can only remove elements in O(n), for similar reasons. But the dynamic array can remove elements from the end of the list in O(1), whereas that operation is in O(n) for the linked list.

Accessing elements of this dynamic array by index is O(1) because it only involves computing a pointer offset. Accessing elements of the linked list by index that aren't the head or tail is O(n) because it is necessary to traverse the list, starting from the `head`, to find the desired element.

In general, the linked list trades off faster insertion/removal at the beginning of the list for slower removal of elements from the end of the list, and slower indexing through the list.
