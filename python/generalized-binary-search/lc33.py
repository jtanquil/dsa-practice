# LC 33. There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

# Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown
# pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is
# [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]
# (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and
# become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

# Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return
# the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# If the array is rotated by some pivot index k, then when splitting the array
# down the middle there are two cases:
# - the pivot is at mid
# - the pivot is to the left or right of mid
# - in the first case, both the left and right halves are already sorted
# - in the second, one half will be sorted, the other will be sorted with a pivot
# in either case, we can just recursively search each half and return left half | right half
# (note that this works since the array elements are distinct)
# since we're cutting the array in half each iteration this will be O(2 log n/2) = O(log n)
